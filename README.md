# Jobs Profiler

The Jobs Profiler is designed to visualize and analyze the execution of Unity's C# Job System. It collects, caches, and processes detailed profiling data about jobs, threads, and their dependencies for each frame.

• Inspect when and how jobs are scheduled, executed, and completed.
• Visualize job dependencies and flow between jobs and threads.
• Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize job-based code.
• View detailed timing and categorization of job events per frame.
